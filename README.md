## Description ##

This repository contains the code for operation of the Opentrons OT2 robot for an automated enzyme engineering project conducted by Gonzalo Bidart.

There are four steps in the workflow performed in the robot:
  1. Inoculation of 4 culture plates (Plates B) with precultures (Plate A)
  2. Inducement of expression by addition of IPTG 
  3. Resuspension of expression pellet in lysis buffer
